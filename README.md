# Arch Dotfiles

My personal Arch dotfiles, scripts and packages.

These include my configs for:

- Hyprland
- Waybar
- Neovim
- Rofi
- Pywal
- Mako
- Ncmpcpp
- Zsh
- Kitty
- Fastfetch
- Wireplumber
- Gammastep

This README will have all the necessary steps to replicate the essentials of my system as well as other optional configurations.

You can run the interactive setup script **Work in progress** which will go through all the steps needed to replicate this system. The only requirement needed is that this repo needs to be in your home directory.

Otherwise, the manual setup steps are down below.


## Requirements

Ensure you have the following on your system

### Git

```
pacman -S --needed base-devel git
```

j
### Stow

```
pacman -S stow
```

### Fonts

Certain configs require specific fonts

Download the fonts using

```
$ pacman -S ttf-fira-sans ttf-iosevka-nerd ttf-font-awesome ttf-meslo-nerd 
```

Or install alongside the rest of the packages later


## Installation and Setup

Check out archdots repo in $HOME directory using git

```
$ git clone https://github.com/FuzionDragon/archdots.git
$ cd archdots
```

### Use GNU stow to create symlinks

**Make sure your ~/.config directory is properly setup or else unpredictable results may happen (trust me, it was a pain when I found out the issue)**

```
$ stow .
```

**If there are any existing dotfiles on the system**

```
$ stow --adopt .
$ git restore .
```

### Zsh

Set Zsh as default shell

```
$ chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
```

Restart the terminal emulator or source the config to apply config

### Pywal and Wallpapers 

Wallpapers are needed at $HOME/Wallpapers for Pywal to work

Check out wallpapers repo if you want to use my favourite wallpapers

```
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone https://github.com/FuzionDragon/Wallpapers.git
```


## Optional Steps

Steps for restoring my system outside of configs

### Configure Pacman

Edit the config file

```
$ nvim /etc/pacman.conf 
```

### Install Aur Helper (paru)

Check out paru repo in $HOME directory using git

```
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
$ cd paru
$ makepkg -si
```
### Install Packages using pkglist in the archdots repo 


For faster package downloads

```
$ paru -S reflector
$ reflector --verbose --country 'United Kingdom' --sort rate -l 10 --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

Install the essential packages

```
$ cd $HOME/archdots
$ paru -S --needed - < .pkglist.txt
```

To install the AUR packages

**Reminder to self, AUR packages must be enabled in pacman config**

```
$ cd $HOME/archdots
$ paru -S --needed - < .aurpkglist.txt
```

**Note: These pkglist files don't have Intel and Nvidia cpu and gpu drivers, so they will need to be installed seperately if needed**


### TLP

Install TLP

```
$ paru -S tlp
```

Configure

```
$ nvim /etc/tlp.conf
```

Then reboot or run

```
$ tlp start
```

You may need to add it as a systemd service before running the above command

### Grub Config

```
$ nvim /etc/default/grub
```

For dual-booting, change the line in grub config

```
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```

Then run the command

```
$ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### Kanata

To apply my Kanata bindings, make sure it is enabled as a systemd service, **[discussion to how found here](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/130)**.

If you wish to have it be globally available copy the config file from .config to /etc/kanata/config.kbd
